## Deep Learning with Python

### Chapter 2: The mathematical building blocks of neural networks
- Tensors from the foundation of the modern ML systems. They come in various flavors of dtype, rank, and shape.
- You can manipulate numerical tensors via tensor operations which can be interpreted as encoding geometric transformantions. Everything in DL is amenable to a geometric interpretation.
- DL models consist of chains of simple tensor operations, parameterized by weights, which are themselves tensors. The weights of a model are where its "knowledge" is stored.
- Learning means finding a set of values for a model's weights that minimize the loss function given a set of training samples and their corresponding target.
- Learning happens by drawing random batches of data samples and their targets, and computing the gradient of the model parameters with respect to the loss on the batch. The model parameters are then moved a bit in the opposite direction from gradient. This is called "mini-batch SGD".
- The entire learning process ois made possible by the fact that all tensor operations in NN are differentiable, thus it is possible to apply the chain rule of derivativation to find the gradient function mapping the current parameters and current batch of data to a gradient value.
- Loss is the quantity you'll attempt to minimize during training. It represents the measurement of success for the task you're trying to solve.
- Optimizer specifies the exact way in which the gradient of the loss with be used to update parameters: RMSProp or SGD or SGD with momenntum.

### Chapter 3: Introduction to Keras and Tensorflow
- TensorFlow is an industry-strength numerical computing framework that can run on CPU, GPU, or TPU. It can automatically compute the gradient of any differentiable expression, it can be distributed to many devices, and it can export programs to various external runtimes—even JavaScript.
- Key TensorFlow objects include tensors, variables, tensor operations, and the gradient tape.
- The central class of Keras is the Layer. A layer encapsulates some weights and some computation. Layers are assembled into models.
- Before you start training a model, you need to pick an optimizer, a loss, and some metrics, which you specify via the model.compile() method.
- To train a model, you can use the fit() method, which runs mini-batch gradient descent for you. You can also use it to monitor your loss and metrics on validation data, a set of inputs that the model doesn’t see during training.
- Once your model is trained, you use the model.predict() method to generate predictions on new inputs.
